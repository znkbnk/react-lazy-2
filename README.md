In this project, you will practice
using the React.lazy function to 
lazily load components in your
React application. React.lazy is 
a feature introduced in React 16.6
that allows you to load components
lazily, which can improve the initial
loading time of your application
by only loading the necessary
components when needed.

Step 1: Set up a React project

- Set up a new React project using
your preferred method, such as 
Create React App or by setting up
the project manually.
- Make sure you have Node.js and npm
(Node Package Manager) installed
on your system.

Step 2: Create a simple application
structure

- Create a basic application structure
with a main component and some
child components.
- Use dummy data or placeholders for
any required data or props.

Step 3: Identify components that
can be lazily loaded

- Review your application structure
and identify components that are not
immediately required when the
application loads.
- Choose one or more of these
components to practice lazy loading.

Step 4: Install React.lazy and
React.Suspense

-Install the necessary packages by 
running the following command in
your project's root directory:
npm install react react-dom

Step 5: Implement lazy loading

- Import the required components at 
the top of your main component file.
- Replace the import statements of the
chosen components with React.lazy()
function calls, passing a function
that returns a dynamic import
statement for each component.
- Wrap the lazy-loaded component(s)
with the React.Suspense component
in your main component file.

Step 6: Test and verify

- Run your React application and
verify that the lazy-loaded
component(s) are loaded only
when needed.
- Confirm that the initial loading
time of your application is improved
due to the lazy loading.

Step 7: Repeat steps 5-6 for
additional components

- If you have identified multiple
components that can be lazily loaded,
repeat steps 5 and 6 for each component.

Step 8: Optimize and refactor

- Analyze the performance of your
application and identify any areas
that can be further optimized.
- Look for opportunities to improve
the lazy loading implementation
or make other performance enhancements.
- Refactor your code as needed to
optimize the application's performance.

Step 9: Document and summarize

- Document your implementation and 
any findings or observations during
the project.
- Summarize the benefits and drawbacks
of using React.lazy and lazy loading
in your application.
- Reflect on how lazy loading can be
useful in real-world scenarios and
future projects.
